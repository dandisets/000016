description: 'This package contains data, in NWB (Neurodata Without Borders) format,
  from the 4 mice included in "Najafi, Farzaneh, Gamaleldin F. Elsayed, Robin Cao,
  Eftychios Pnevmatikakis, Peter E. Latham, John P. Cunningham, and Anne K. Churchland.
  "Excitatory and inhibitory subnetworks are equally selective during decision-making
  and emerge simultaneously during learning." Neuron 105, no. 1 (2020): 165-179.”
  Each NWB file represents the data and metadata associated with one recording session.
  In each NWB file, the metadata related to the session (mouse name, session date/time,
  lab/institution name, etc.) can be found under "general". Information related to
  ROI-segmentation such as ROI mask, ROI type (excitatory or inhibitory), poor or
  good quality, etc. can be found under "modules/Image-Segmentation/pln-seg". Trial
  information (e.g. start, end times, trial types, trial outcomes, etc.) can be found
  under "trials". Recorded trial-segmented neuronal responses aligned to different
  time event (e.g. stimulus start, animal choice, etc.) can be found under "modules/
  Trial-based-Segmentation". A jupyter notebook presenting in detail how to work with
  NWB files is provided at https://github.com/ttngu207/najafi-2018-nwb/blob/master/notebooks/Najafi-2018_example.ipynb.'
